# Spectroscopy Batch Processing
This little script takes all of the data from a folder, calibrates the wavelength axis, and produces basic but informative plots easily.
Other students should pull their data up in igor as well, this is meant to be helpful. 
I also reccomend working off of this to make their own scripts for whatever they might need

# TODO
Work off of the peak detection and impliment a multi-lorenzian model for the calibration data to improve accuracy

:shit:

This file has functions to find the maximum values of some spectral data, and to interpolate an axis
